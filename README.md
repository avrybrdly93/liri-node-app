# liri-node-app

This application was created in nodeJS with the intention of assisting a user in finding results for specific searches.  The user can search amongst songs, artists, and albums through the spotify API, upcoming concerts via the bands-in-town API, and information about movies with the OMDB API.  

To use the app, simple clone the repo.  In order to use the spotify API, one must gain access to their own API key which can be attained through the spotify developers website.  
With just a few simple commands, an immense amount of information will be at your fingertips:

   ```node liri.js spotify-this-song <name of song>```

   ```node liri.js concert-this <name of artist>```

   ```node liri.js movie-this <name of movie>```
   
Attached is a link to a video of the developer of this application demonstrating how to successfully use it.
